:%s/\nC\(\/C++\)\? Program //g =>
Convert lines like 
C Program to count number of lines in a file
C/C++ Program for Check if a number is Palindrome
To
to count number of lines in a file
for Check if a number is Palindrome
To count the number of matches of a pattern, use the substitute command with the n flag. The following shows the number of times that pattern matches text in the current buffer: 
:%s/pattern//gn
Omit g to display the number of lines where the pattern matches: 
:%s/pattern//n

:%s/^$\n//g    => removes all blank lines
:%s/\/\/.*//g  => Remove all single line comments in java(e.g.//Constructor)

:%s/foo/bar/g 
Find each occurrence of 'foo' (in all lines), and replace it with 'bar'. 
:s/foo/bar/g 
Find each occurrence of 'foo' (in the current line only), and replace it with 'bar'. 
:%s/foo/bar/gc 
Change each 'foo' to 'bar', but ask for confirmation first. 
:%s/\<foo\>/bar/gc 
Change only whole words exactly matching 'foo' to 'bar'; ask for confirmation. 
:%s/foo/bar/gci 
Change each 'foo' (case insensitive due to the i flag) to 'bar'; ask for confirmation. 
:%s/foo\c/bar/gc is the same because \c makes the search case insensitive. 
This may be wanted after using :set noignorecase to make searches case sensitive (the default). 
:%s/foo/bar/gcI 
Change each 'foo' (case sensitive due to the I flag) to 'bar'; ask for confirmation. 
:%s/foo\C/bar/gc is the same because \C makes the search case sensitive. 
This may be wanted after using :set ignorecase to make searches case insensitive. 

How to configure ctags for vim?

To save the file in this case simply type as below and provide the root password. That’s it
:w !sudo tee %
