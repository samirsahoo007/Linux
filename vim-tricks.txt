:%s/\nC\(\/C++\)\? Program //g =>
Convert lines like 
C Program to count number of lines in a file
C/C++ Program for Check if a number is Palindrome
To
to count number of lines in a file
for Check if a number is Palindrome
To count the number of matches of a pattern, use the substitute command with the n flag. The following shows the number of times that pattern matches text in the current buffer: 
:%s/pattern//gn
Omit g to display the number of lines where the pattern matches: 
:%s/pattern//n

:%s/^$\n//g    => removes all blank lines
:%s/\/\/.*//g  => Remove all single line comments in java(e.g.//Constructor)
:%s/,/\r/g     => replace , with new line; \n doesn't work here
:%s/^/#/       => This adds # at the beginning of every line
:%s/$/,/       => This adds , at the end of every line


:%s/foo/bar/g 
Find each occurrence of 'foo' (in all lines), and replace it with 'bar'. 
:s/foo/bar/g 
Find each occurrence of 'foo' (in the current line only), and replace it with 'bar'. 
:%s/foo/bar/gc 
Change each 'foo' to 'bar', but ask for confirmation first. 
:%s/\<foo\>/bar/gc 
Change only whole words exactly matching 'foo' to 'bar'; ask for confirmation. 
:%s/foo/bar/gci 
Change each 'foo' (case insensitive due to the i flag) to 'bar'; ask for confirmation. 
:%s/foo\c/bar/gc is the same because \c makes the search case insensitive. 
This may be wanted after using :set noignorecase to make searches case sensitive (the default). 
:%s/foo/bar/gcI 
Change each 'foo' (case sensitive due to the I flag) to 'bar'; ask for confirmation. 
:%s/foo\C/bar/gc is the same because \C makes the search case sensitive. 
This may be wanted after using :set ignorecase to make searches case insensitive. 

:g/profile/d    => delete all lines containing "profile" (remove the /d to show the lines that the command will delete):
:g/^\s*$/d      => deleting all lines that are empty or that contain only whitespace
