Que: How to resolve the following error:
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/etc/pki/tls/cert.pem'

Ans:
Configure OpenSSL
====================
Generate a self-signed certificate (OpenSSL)

Using OpenSSL we will generate a self-signed certificate.
If you are using this on a production server you are probably likely to want a key from Trusted Certificate Authority, but if you are just using this on a personal site or for testing purposes a self-signed certificate is fine. To create the key you will need to be root so you can either su to root or use sudo in front of the commands

# Generate private key default is 1024 better is 2048
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 1024

# Generate CSR
openssl req -new -key ca.key -out ca.csr

# Generate Self Signed Key
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in ca.csr -signkey ca.key -out ca.crt

# Copy the files to the correct locations
cp ca.crt /etc/pki/tls/certs
cp ca.key /etc/pki/tls/private/ca.key
cp ca.csr /etc/pki/tls/private/ca.csr

Command used for creating .pem file for webmin
cat ca.crt ca.key | sudo tee ca.pem > /dev/null
